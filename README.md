# LyokoSass


So I noticed that I really have only been using CSS preprocessors for nesting, variables, and some mixins.  However I haven't been utilizing the full potential of all the amazing things that Sass can do.  So I am going to experiment a bit and write my tests in this repository.

You can see the Sass documentation at http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html
